Centralized Public Key management for small teams with lots of servers

#Why?
 
Because my team has many servers, many developers and few system administrators and LDAP is great but it adds more overhead.

#How?

The basic idea is that anyone on the team who already has key based access as a specific user can be trusted to grant that same access
to others. You or your system administrator may disagree but in practice this makes sense for small to medium sized teams.
